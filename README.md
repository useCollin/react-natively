## REACT NATIVELY PROJECT
### Overview
This codebase deploys a next.js app and a react native app in expo go. 
The components are written with react-native and the idea is to maximize
code reuse of UI elements accross mobile and web experiences while 
improving and developer experience. The content of the website and app itself
will be demos, articles and tutorials about deep react native integrations that are
currently evolving at a rapid clip.

It is a way to learn about, innovate on and teach how to use these tools.
The goal is to help myself and others build great cross-platform products that are a blast to work on. 

### Quickstart
this assumes some react native and nextjs set up/understanding. More detailed instructions will follow

#### For Mobile
run `yarn start` bundles  and connect via the expo go app on your phone. You can run it on an emulator by following the official react native setup instructions. 

#### For the Next/Web app
run `npx next dev` 
run yarn dev to run the next development server.

### Current State
SWC support is inabled for the next site and the expo app is building so you can launch all three and go from there. The plan is to mature but this is a good boilerplate for this kind of project at this point.
